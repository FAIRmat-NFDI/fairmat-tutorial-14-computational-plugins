	abstract = {The WIEN2k program is based on the augmented plane wave plus local orbitals (APW+lo) method to solve the Kohn–Sham equations of density functional theory. The APW+lo method, which considers all electrons (core and valence) self-consistently in a full-potential treatment, is implemented very efficiently in WIEN2k, since various types of parallelization are available and many optimized numerical libraries can be used. Many properties can be calculated, ranging from the basic ones, such as the electronic band structure or the optimized atomic structure, to more specialized ones such as the nuclear magnetic resonance shielding tensor or the electric polarization. After a brief presentation of the APW+lo method, we review the usage, capabilities, and features of WIEN2k (version 19) in detail. The various options, properties, and available approximations for the exchange-correlation functional, as well as the external libraries or programs that can be used with WIEN2k, are mentioned. References to relevant applications and some examples are also given.},

	abstract = {The calculation of the electronic structure of large systems by methods based on density functional theory has recently gained a central role in molecular simulations. However, the extensive study of quantities like excited states and related properties is still out of reach due to high computational costs. We present a new implementation of a hybrid method, the Gaussian and Augmented-Plane-Wave (GAPW) method, where the electronic density is partitioned in hard and soft contributions. The former are local terms naturally expanded in a Gaussian basis, whereas the soft contributions are expanded in plane-waves by using a low energy cutoff, without loss in accuracy, even for all-electron calculations. For the calculation of excitation energies a recently developed, time-dependent density functional response theory (TD-DFRT) technique is joined with the GAPW procedure. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by comparison with standard quantum chemistry calculations for a set of small molecules. To highlight the performance and efficiency of GAPW we show calculations on systems with several thousands of basis functions.},

	abstract = {Linearized augmented planewave methods are known as the most precise numerical schemes for solving the Kohn–Sham equations of density-functional theory (DFT). In this review, we describe how this method is realized in the all-electron full-potential computer package, exciting. We emphasize the variety of different related basis sets, subsumed as (linearized) augmented planewave plus local orbital methods, discussing their pros and cons and we show that extremely high accuracy (microhartrees) can be achieved if the basis is chosen carefully. As the name of the code suggests, exciting is not restricted to ground-state calculations, but has a major focus on excited-state properties. It includes time-dependent DFT in the linear-response regime with various static and dynamical exchange-correlation kernels. These are preferably used to compute optical and electron-loss spectra for metals, molecules and semiconductors with weak electron–hole interactions. exciting makes use of many-body perturbation theory for charged and neutral excitations. To obtain the quasi-particle band structure, the GW approach is implemented in the single-shot approximation, known as G0W0. Optical absorption spectra for valence and core excitations are handled by the solution of the Bethe–Salpeter equation, which allows for the description of strongly bound excitons. Besides these aspects concerning methodology, we demonstrate the broad range of possible applications by prototypical examples, comprising elastic properties, phonons, thermal-expansion coefﬁcients, dielectric tensors and loss functions, magneto-optical Kerr effect, core-level spectra and more.},

A diverse set of stakeholders---representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers---have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},
