In NOMAD, we give support to workflows and understand them as a way of organizing data to keep the full provenance of an activity (either experimental or computational). Workflows can be also parsed in NOMAD in two slightly different ways: in an automatic way or by defining a custom workflow additional file. The first case is done when the simulation input and output files contain enough information to recognize a certain workflow, and it is typically done in the parser plugin. You can read more on how to prepare your input/output files to make this automatic recognition easier in the Extra: Standard workflows recognition section at the end of this page.</p> <p>This part of the Tutorial will show you the basic concepts of workflows in NOMAD, as well as how to define your own custom workflow.

This folder structure presents a typical workflow calculation which can be represented as a provenance graph:</p> <p>Note that the arrows here indicate directionality of the nodes inputs, tasks (DFT, TB, DMFT), and outputs. Here, input refers to the all input information given to perform the calculation. In Part II - NOMAD-Simulations, we saw that the input is further divided in the <code>ModelSystem</code> information (i.e., atom positions, cell information, etc.) and the <code>ModelMethod</code> information (i.e., the mathematical model and numerical parameters). <code>DFT</code>, <code>TB</code> and <code>DMFT</code> refer to individual tasks of the workflow, and refers to the activity Simulation. Output refers to the output data of each of the final DMFT tasks and is directly related with the <code>Outputs</code> section defined in Part II - NOMAD-Simulations.</p> <p>Go to the NOMAD Upload page, create a new upload, and drag-and-drop the zipped <code>example_files.zip</code> file.

In the Part II - NOMAD-Simulations, we showed you the definitions that populate the <code>data</code> section. However, the current parsers in NOMAD still use the legacy section <code>run</code>, and that is why we need to still use references to these sections. Nevertheless, the structure of the legacy <code>run</code> schema and the new <code>data</code> schema is the same: in the legacy schema we had the <code>System</code> - <code>Method</code> - <code>Calculation</code> sub-sections, while in the new schema we have <code>ModelSystem</code> - <code>ModelMethod</code> - <code>Outputs</code>, and the very same reasoning will apply once we finish the migration.</p> <p>Drag this new file into the upload we created. This will produce an extra entry with the following Overview content:</p> <p>Note that you are referencing sections which are lists. Thus, in each case you should be careful to reference the correct section for inputs and outputs (example: a <code>GeometryOptimization</code> workflow calculation will have the \"Input structure\" as <code>run[0].system[0]</code>, while the \"Output calculation\" would also contain <code>run[0].system[-1]</code>, and all intermediate steps must input/output the corresponding section to be linked).</p> NOMAD workflow filename <p>The NOMAD workflow YAML file name, i.e., <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> in the explanation above, can be any custom name defined by the user, but the file must keep the extension <code>.archive.yaml</code> at the end. This is done in order for NOMAD to recognize this file as a custom schema. Custom schemas are widely used in experimental parsing, and you can learn more about them in the FAIRmat tutorial 8.</p> <p>You can extend the workflow meta-information by adding the metholodogical input parameters as stored in the section path <code>run[0].method[-1]</code>.

Strictly speaking, this equivalency is not entirely true, as we are loosing it in some cases. But for the purpose of learning the complicated rules of inheritance and composition, we will conceptually maintain this equivalency during this Tutorial.</p> <p>A set of base sections derived from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is used as the basis for our section definitions.

We are going to store a self-consistently calculated <code>FermiLevel</code>, whose values at each step are <code>[1, 1.5, 2, 2.1, 2.101]</code> in eV. Add the appropiate references to the <code>ModelMethod</code> and <code>ModelSystem</code> sections created in Assignment 2.3 and Assignment 2.6, respectively. For the self-consistently calculated <code>FermiLevel</code> section, add the reference to the section <code>SelfConsistency</code> created in Assignment 2.4.</p> <p>Check if the <code>FermiLevel</code> is self-consistently converged or not by using a class method from <code>SCFOutputs</code>. What happens if the <code>SelfConsistency.threshold_change</code> is now <code>1e-24</code>?</p> Solution 2.7 <p>We can import and create an instance of <code>SCFOutputs</code> and append it to simulation: <pre><code>from nomad_simulations.schema_packages.outputs import SCFOutputs\nscf_outputs = SCFOutputs()\nsimulation.outputs.append(scf_outputs)\n</code></pre></p> <p>We can add the references to the other <code>ModelMethod</code> and <code>ModelSystem</code> sections by doing: <pre><code>scf_outputs.model_method_ref = simulation.model_method[0]\nscf_outputs.model_system_ref = simulation.model_system[0]\n</code></pre></p> <p>Now, we need to create the <code>scf_steps</code> sub-sections with the information of the <code>FermiLevel</code> steps and their values. For that, <pre><code>from nomad_simulations.schema_packages.outputs import Outputs\nfrom nomad_simulations.schema_packages.properties import FermiLevel\nfor value in [1, 1.5, 2, 2.1, 2.101]:\n    fermi_level = FermiLevel()\n    fermi_level.value = value * ureg.eV\n    scf_outputs.scf_steps.append(Outputs(fermi_levels=[fermi_level]))\n</code></pre> Note that:</p> <ol> <li>The properties like <code>fermi_levels</code> are repeated sub-sections under <code>Outputs</code>, so we need to assign a list.</li> <li>The <code>scf_steps</code> sub-sections are <code>Outputs</code>, hence we need to import the <code>Outputs</code> section and append it to that attribute.</li> </ol> <p>We also need to add the last step directly under <code>scf_outputs</code> and add the reference to the <code>SelfConsistency</code> section: <pre><code>scf_outputs.fermi_levels.append(FermiLevel(value=2.101 * ureg.eV, self_consistency_ref=simulation.model_method[0].numerical_settings[0]))\n</code></pre></p> <p>In order to check if the <code>FermiLevel</code> is converged or not, we can use the class method <code>resolve_is_scf_converged()</code>.

However, if we want to assign first the <code>value</code>: <pre><code>band_gap_T = ElectronicBandGap()\nband_gap_T.value = [1, 1.5, 2] * ureg.eV\n</code></pre> we will get a <code>ValueError</code> due to the fact that <code>variables</code> is not set and the shape of <code>value</code> is not empty: <pre><code>ValueError: The shape of the stored `value` [3] does not match the full shape [] extracted from the variables `n_points` and the `shape` defined in `PhysicalProperty`.\n</code></pre></p> <p>Thus, the <code>variables</code> sub-sections must be set before setting the <code>value</code> of a physical property. This is because the <code>class PhysicalProperty</code> is doing validations on the shape of the <code>variables</code> and <code>value</code>, and it only works if <code>variables</code> is set first.

In practice, however, parser developers have to manage discrepancies in semantics, shape, data type or units. This has lead to five distinct categories of responsibility for the developer to manage. Here, they are ordered to match the parser's execution:</p> <ol> <li>file selection - navigate the upload's folder structure and select the relevant files.</li> <li>source extraction - read the files into Python. This step may already include some level of data field filtering.</li> <li>source to target - map the data of interest with their counterparts in the target/NOMAD schema. This is where the bulk of the filtering happens.</li> <li>data mangling - manipulate the data to match the target/NOMAD <code>Quantity</code>s' specification, e.g. dimensionality, shape. This may include computing derived properties not present in the original source files.</li> <li>archive construction - build up a Python <code>EntryArchive</code> object using the classes provided by the target/NOMAD schema. NOMAD will automatically write and commit it to the database as an <code>archive.json</code></li> </ol> <p>Blurring these responsibilities leads to a wild-growth in parser design and added complexity, especially in larger, more feature-rich parsers. NOMAD therefore offers powerful tools and documentation on best practices to help the parser developer manage each distinct responsibility. The exact solutions are, in the same order:</p> <ol> <li><code>MatchingParser</code> - This class selects the file to be parsed. Since it interfaces with the NOMAD base directly, it will read in most of the settings automatically from there.</li> <li><code>XMLParser</code> and co. / <code>TextParser</code> - There are several reader classes for loading common source formats into Python data types. Examples include the <code>XMLParser</code> and <code>HDF5Parser</code>. We will demonstrate <code>XMLParser</code> in Parsing Hierarchical Tree Formats. Plain text files, meanwhile, involve an additional matching step via the <code>TextParser</code>. More on this in From Text to Hierarchies.</li> <li><code>MappingAnnotationModel</code> - This is arguably the most involved part for the parser developer, as this is where the external data gets further semantically enriched and standardized. It requires domain expertise to understand the relationship between the data fields in the source file and the NOMAD-Simulations schema. If step 2 went well, step 3 could just involve annotating the target/NOMAD schema. We show how this is conceptually possible with <code>MappingAnnotationModel</code> in Mapping a to Schema, but note that it still at the prototype stage.</li> <li>NOMAD-Simulations schema / <code>MappingAnnotationModel</code> - The <code>MSection</code>s and <code>utils.py</code> in the schema provide normalizers and helper functions to alleviate most of the data mangling. For small amendments, use the mapping approach described in Via Mapping. For larger ones, consider extending the schema as covered in Extending NOMAD-Simulations.</li> <li><code>MetainfoParser</code> - this converter bridges the annotated schema from step 3 with the reader classes in step 2. <code>MetainfoParser.data_object</code> contains the final <code>ArchiveSection</code> that is stored under <code>archive.data</code>.</li> </ol> <p>In the next section, we will briefly illustrate how <code>MatchingParser</code>, <code>XMLParser</code>, and <code>MetainfoParser</code> interconnect, as well as flesh out some setup details.</p>"},{"location":"parser_plugins/#starting-a-plugin-project","title":"Starting a Plugin Project","text":"<p>To create your own parser plugin, visit our plugin template and click the \u201cUse this template\u201d button.
